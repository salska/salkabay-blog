# Introduction

I've always been fascinated by the seemingly random and yet periodic nature of any stock price chart. Stock market prices follow a periodic pattern which oscillates about a drifting baseline over time. Modelling such a pattern with a mathematical equation to create a predictive model is actually impossible. 

However, there are many ways to skin the proverbial cat. Sorry Milo! When we superimpose selected technical indicators over a stock price chart in just about any timeframe, what we will see is that these complex patterns do repeat over and over again. This is true for stock candle charts that aggregate bars at varying time intervals. The same patterns can also be observed in different assets. 

A few years ago I started modelling various algorithms to detect these complex patterns and compile probabilistic pattern matching of profiles across assets. This application has now evolved to take any stock price snapshot and identify similar patterns from a historical database of 100s of assets each with up to 40 to 90 years worth of historical data. 

Building such a qualitative model using qualitative pattern matching techniques from the field of digital signal processing and AI based algorithms has provided a basis for predicting the likely future path of a stock given any historical snapshot. 

Although the processing is highly compute intensive, . using python based parallel processing techniques my custom built application is capable of performing pattern analysis on 100 stocks and the full history of the available daily data sets. It's pretty cool. 

Using this software, I have developed insights that allow me to enter winning trades most of the time. The issue is always to limit losses and exit safely when it does not work out.
