I love Noodles.

**Son**: sorry dad

**Dad**: sorry doesn't make the noodles. What were you doing up there? All that noise!

**Son**: oh nothing … just had a crazy dream

**Dad**: huh ... what were you dreaming about?

**Son**: what was I … I was dreaming about noodles

**Dad**: noodles … you were really dreaming about noodles? My **Son** you don't know how long I've been waiting for this moment. This is a sign that you are almost ready to be entrusted with my secret ingredient recipe that will make you fulfil your destiny and take over the restaurant just as I took it over from my father who took it over from his father who won it from his friend in a game of mahjongg

**Son**: dad dad dad it was just a dream

**Dad**: No. It was THEE dream. We are noodle folk. Broth runs through our veins

**Son**: but dad ... didn't you ever want to do something else? Something besides noodles

**Dad**: actually when I was young and crazy I thought about running away and learning how to make tofu

**Son**: so why didn't you?

**Dad**: oh because it was a stupid dream - can you imagine me making tofu? No. We all have our place in this world - my place is here and yours is …

**Son**: I know its also here

**Dad**: No. It's at table two, five, seven and twelve - service with a smile
