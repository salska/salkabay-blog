# Borgas Trading App
The original Borgas App was written in matlab as a series of algorithms to prototype the import and display of asset price candle bars. Simple technical indicators were developed and to overlay on price charts.

A python based borgas app was then developed to implement an interactive solution with pattern matching capabilities.

An enhanced version of this tool could be developed as a web-based subscription service.

## Capabilities
- import and display selected asset prices
- live web-based refresh of asset prices to keep them up to date
- overlay key simple moving average technical indicators
- tag and mark key technical patterns
- perform normalised pattern matching and listing of asset price and technical patterns across all assets
