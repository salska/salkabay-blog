Sal Kabay has a PhD in Biomedical Engineering and a leading technologist who specialises in Digital Enablement for leading Clients. You may be seeking a trusted advisor and someone who has a proven delivery track record.

**Are you embarking on a significant business change and need to mobilise productive and enthusiastic people
to rapidly deliver new structures, processes or technologies?**

My skills are in strategy, architecture, systems integration and technical delivery: engaging people to
formalise ideas to deliver change in an agile and enjoyable way.
My experience is in complex organisational situations that are facing severe business and technology
pressures: enabling the significant changes in both capabilities and mindset needed to adapt successfully in
the digital world.

I adopt a start-up attitude and collaborative consultancy ethos to accelerate business change, technology
refresh and digital transformation.

**Recently, I was responsible for modernising a strategic digital identity solution that allowed Scottish citizens
to safely and securely access all public sector services.**
